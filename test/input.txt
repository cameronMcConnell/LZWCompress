LZW compression is a lossless data compression algorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. It is widely used in various file formats, such as GIF and TIFF, due to its efficiency in compressing repetitive data. The algorithm replaces sequences of characters with shorter codes, reducing the overall file size. This makes it particularly effective for text and image files with lots of recurring patterns. Understanding how LZW works helps in appreciating its impact on data storage and transmission.
